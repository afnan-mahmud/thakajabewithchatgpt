# Search Functionality Update

## Overview
Updated the homepage search functionality to provide smart location autocomplete suggestions and comprehensive multi-field search across room listings.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend - New Locations API Endpoint
**File**: `thaka_jabe-server/src/routes/locations.ts` (NEW)

Created a new API endpoint for location autocomplete:
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/locations?s={searchTerm}`
- **Purpose**: Returns unique location names from approved room listings
- **Features**:
  - Aggregates unique `locationName` values from approved rooms
  - Filters by search term (case-insensitive regex)
  - Sorts by popularity (number of rooms per location)
  - Returns top 10 results
  - Response format: `[{ id, label, count }]`

### 2. Backend - Updated Search Endpoint
**File**: `thaka_jabe-server/src/routes/rooms.ts`

Enhanced the `/api/rooms/search` endpoint to search across multiple fields:

**Search Fields** (when `q` parameter is provided):
- `title` - Room title/name
- `locationName` - Location name
- `description` - Room description
- `address` - Full address

**Search Logic**:
- Uses case-insensitive regex search across all four fields
- Properly combines search query (`q`) and location filter using `$and` + `$or` operators
- Supports both general search and specific location filtering simultaneously

**Updated Sort Options**:
- `newest` - Sort by creation date (descending)
- `oldest` - Sort by creation date (ascending)
- `price_asc` - Sort by price (ascending)
- `price_desc` - Sort by price (descending)
- `rating` - Sort by average rating and total reviews (descending)

### 3. Backend - Register New Route
**File**: `thaka_jabe-server/src/index.ts`

- Imported and registered the new locations route
- Added `app.use('/api/locations', locationRoutes);`

### 4. Frontend - Location Autocomplete
**File**: `thakajabe/components/search/LocationCombobox.tsx`

Already configured to fetch from `/api/locations` endpoint:
- Automatically fetches location suggestions as user types
- Shows top 6 default locations when no input
- Shows top 8 filtered locations when searching
- Keyboard navigation support (arrows, enter, escape)
- Click to select location

### 5. Frontend - Search Bar (HomePage)
**File**: `thakajabe/components/home/SearchBarLarge.tsx`

Updated the search handler:
- Now passes both `q` (general search) and `location` (specific filter) parameters
- Ensures comprehensive search across all relevant fields
- Maintains date and guest parameters

### 6. Frontend - Search Bar (TopNav)
**File**: `thakajabe/components/navigation/TopNav.tsx`

Updated the search handler:
- Consistent with homepage search bar
- Passes both `q` and `location` parameters
- Works seamlessly with the location autocomplete

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. **User starts typing** in the location search field
2. **Autocomplete suggestions** appear from existing room locations
3. **User selects a location** from suggestions or continues typing
4. **User clicks Search** button
5. **System searches** across:
   - Room titles
   - Location names
   - Descriptions
   - Addresses
6. **Results displayed** showing all matching properties

### Example Searches:

**Search: "Bashundhara"**
- Finds rooms where:
  - Title contains "Bashundhara"
  - Location name is "Bashundhara"
  - Description mentions "Bashundhara"
  - Address includes "Bashundhara"

**Search: "Luxurious AC Room"**
- Finds rooms where:
  - Title contains "Luxurious AC Room"
  - Description mentions "Luxurious AC Room"
  - Location or address might also match

## API Examples

### Get Location Suggestions:
```bash
GET /api/locations?s=Bash
Response: [
  { "id": "Bashundhara", "label": "Bashundhara", "count": 5 },
  ...
]
```

### Search Rooms:
```bash
GET /api/rooms/search?q=Bashundhara&location=Bashundhara&page=1&limit=12&sort=newest
Response: {
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "rooms": [...],
    "pagination": {...},
    "filters": {...}
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Smart Autocomplete**: Suggestions based on real location data
2. **Comprehensive Search**: Searches across title, location, description, and address
3. **Better UX**: Users can find rooms by any relevant information
4. **Consistent**: Same search behavior on homepage and top navigation
5. **Performant**: Aggregated location data with caching-friendly structure

## Testing

To test the new functionality:

1. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd thaka_jabe-server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd thakajabe
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test scenarios**:
   - Type in location field → should see suggestions
   - Select a location → should populate field
   - Click search → should navigate to results with proper filters
   - Try partial matches (e.g., "Bash" should suggest "Bashundhara")
   - Try full text search (e.g., "AC Room" should find rooms with AC in title/description)

## Database Requirements

No database migrations required. The search works with existing Room schema fields:
- `title` (existing)
- `locationName` (existing)
- `description` (existing)
- `address` (existing)
- `status` (existing - must be 'approved')
