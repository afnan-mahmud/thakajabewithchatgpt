# SSLCommerz Payment Methods Guide

## Issue: Limited Payment Options

### Problem
When clicking "Confirm and Pay", the SSLCommerz gateway was only showing **card payment options**, missing:
- ❌ bKash
- ❌ Nagad  
- ❌ Rocket
- ❌ Other mobile banking options
- ❌ Internet banking

### Root Cause
The payment initialization included a `multi_card_name` parameter that was **restricting** payment methods to only specific cards:
```javascript
multi_card_name: 'brac_visa,mastercard,amex,dbbl_nexus'
```

This parameter tells SSLCommerz to **only show** those specific card types, hiding all other payment methods.

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Code Change
**File**: `thaka_jabe-server/src/routes/payments.ts`

**Before** (Line 139):
```javascript
multi_card_name: 'brac_visa,mastercard,amex,dbbl_nexus',
```

**After** (Removed):
```javascript
// Removed multi_card_name to enable ALL payment methods:
// - Mobile Banking: bKash, Nagad, Rocket, Upay
// - Cards: Visa, Mastercard, Amex, all local cards
// - Internet Banking: All supported banks
```

### Result
By removing the `multi_card_name` parameter, SSLCommerz will now display **ALL payment methods** that are:
1. ✅ Enabled in your merchant account
2. ✅ Activated by SSLCommerz for your store

## 🔧 Verification Steps

### 1. Check Server Logs

After the fix, when you initialize a payment, check backend logs:

```bash
tail -f thaka_jabe-server/server.log
```

Look for:
```
[PAYMENT_INIT] Payment Data: {
  ...
  // Should NOT have multi_card_name
  ...
}
```

### 2. Test Payment Flow

1. **Create a new booking**
2. **Click "Confirm and Pay"**
3. **On SSLCommerz Gateway**, you should now see:
   - 📱 Mobile Banking tab (bKash, Nagad, Rocket)
   - 💳 Card Payment tab (All cards)
   - 🏦 Internet Banking tab (All banks)

### 3. If Still Limited Options

**Check Your Merchant Account:**

1. Login to [SSLCommerz Merchant Panel](https://merchant.sslcommerz.com/)
2. Go to **Settings** → **Payment Methods**
3. Check which methods are **enabled** for your account
4. If disabled, contact SSLCommerz support

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still Only Seeing Cards

**Solution:**
1. Restart backend server:
   ```bash
   cd thaka_jabe-server
   pkill -f "tsx watch"
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. Clear browser cache
3. Try payment in incognito mode

### Issue: Mobile Banking Shows but Fails

**Possible Causes:**
- Merchant account not fully activated for MFS
- Provider (bKash/Nagad) approval pending
- Test mode limitations

**Solution:**
- Contact SSLCommerz support
- Verify merchant account status
- Check with bKash/Nagad directly

### Issue: Visa Card Not Working

**Note:** Your SSLCommerz account (`thakajabe0live`) should support both Visa and Mastercard. If Visa isn't working:

1. **Check Card Type Support**
   - Some accounts are Mastercard-only initially
   - Contact SSLCommerz to enable Visa

2. **Try Different Visa Card**
   - Some banks have restrictions
   - Try a card from different bank

3. **Check Transaction Limits**
   - Some cards have online transaction limits
   - Verify with card issuing bank
