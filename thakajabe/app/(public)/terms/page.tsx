          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Search for properties using various criteria including destination, dates, guest count, and property type. 
            Search results are prioritized based on relevance to your query, considering factors such as pricing, 
            availability, guest reviews, property owner requirements (minimum/maximum night stays), instant booking 
            availability, and property ratings.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            When you complete a booking, you agree to pay all associated charges, including the listing price, 
            applicable service fees, taxes, and any additional charges presented at checkout (the "Total Amount"). 
            Upon confirmation, a contractual agreement ("Reservation") is established directly between you and the 
            Property Owner. You must comply with all terms of the Reservation, including cancellation policies, 
            house rules, and any specific requirements outlined in the listing. Some Property Owners may work with 
            co-hosts or property management teams.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Your reservation grants you a limited license to occupy the accommodation for the specified period. 
            Property Owners retain the right to access the property when reasonably necessary, as permitted by your 
            agreement and applicable law. Overstaying beyond checkout may result in additional charges. You must not 
            exceed the maximum occupancy specified in the listing.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            When you cancel a reservation, the refund amount is determined by the cancellation policy applicable to 
            that booking. In exceptional circumstances beyond your control, you may qualify for a partial or full 
            refund. If a Property Owner cancels your confirmed booking or you encounter a significant issue as 
            defined in our Refund Policy, you may be eligible for rebooking assistance or refunds.

            Both Guests and Property Owners are responsible for any modifications made through the platform or via

            and respect toward others, and (iii) complying with all applicable laws. If bringing minors, you must have 
            legal authority and are solely responsible for their supervision.

            You acknowledge that using accommodations involves inherent risks. To the maximum extent permitted by law, 
            you assume all risks associated with platform use, property stays, and interactions with other members. 
            You are solely responsible for evaluating property suitability for your needs. Property stays may involve 
            risks of illness, injury, or other harm, which you voluntarily accept by proceeding with your booking.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            You are accountable for your actions and those of anyone assisting you. You must accurately describe all 
            fees in your listing and cannot charge additional fees outside the platform. Do not encourage guests to 
            create external accounts, provide contact information, or conduct transactions off-platform.
